SystemRequirements: gtk+-2.0
Description: This package implements an R graphics device
    based on layers. Users could create shapes on different
    layers and manage them separately. Each layer supports
    some transformations, e.g., moving, scaling and
    rotation. These transformations could be done either by
    calling functions in R or by mouse operations in the
    GUI.
